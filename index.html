            Video games can also teach important skills or address serious issues, organizations such as Games For Change promote the use of games for education and social action, and often involve young people in the creation of games they can use to express themselves on important issues and current events. Some medical professionals, such as Doctor Kourosh Dini, also feel that “age appropriate multi-player video games can allow children to learn how other people think - a key aspect of empathy. Games can also help a child become more comfortable with new and ever progressing technology.” [1]

            Recent studies have shown that video games can have a positive or negative effect on how players behave, depending on the content. Pro-social games can increase empathy, co-operation, helping and emotional awareness, while violent games can diminish these traits. [2]

            Check out the Choosing Good Video Games tip sheet for help in finding great games for kids.

        <p>Hello everyone! I will be talking to you about my inspiration that made me start playing video games! It all started in 2018 i think i was watching youtube and i saw a youtuber play a game called Roblox, i was interested in it and researched it, i asked my dad to make me an account and he did, as soon as he did i played the first game i ever played on roblox called Work at a pizza place.It was so fun and then i started playing more games on roblox like Pokémon Brick Bronze, Jailbreak, bee swarm simulator and more, and that was the beginning of my gaming journey!</p>
